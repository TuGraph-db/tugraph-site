## What is a graph

Graph is a very intuitive data structure to express <strong> things and relationship between them. The basic elements are "point" and "edge". </strong> A point indicate a thing, and an edge represents a certain relationship between them.

For example, in the graph below, the points reprente companies, the employees, projects. The edges represent the relationships between them -- There is an employment relationship between the company and the employee, there can be a friend relationship between the employee and the employee, there can also be a participation relationship between the project and the employee. That is to say, we can use graphs to abstract things and their relationships.

This is a relatively simple structure. As points and edges increase, the graph becomes more and more complex, gradually forming a richer network structure. For example, some financial transactions graph, its size may be very large, more than a billion points, billions or even trillions of edges. As you can imagine, actually working with these graphs can be quite challenging.

## Why is graph computing needed

Thinking of computers as brains, we have two key problems to solve: data storage and analysis .

Traditional data storage uses relational databases with a "table structure" (imagine an Excel spreadsheet). For example, a bank's customer transfer information may include trader, transaction amount, transaction time, which recorded in a table. If there is A direct transfer relationship between transaction A and B, this direct relationship is not difficult to find using a relational database. But for indirect relationships, relational databases are more difficult to "penetrate" multiple points to find, and even if they can be processed, the query can be very slow. Let's take credit card cash out as an example.

The first is the simple cash-out model. As is shown in the picture on the left, a man applies for a credit card, but he doesn't really want to pay it back. He finds a shop, which offers an illegal service: credit card cash. So he pays by credit card and transfers 2,020 yuan to this store. The store returned the 2,000 yuan directly to the payer, thus completing a cash out. Such a cash-out is very simple, we can identify the cash-out behavior through the analysis of the individual, the collection records and payment records of the store.

But the picture on the right is much more complicated. As you can see, this guy in the upper right corner, he's still paying by credit card, he's paying 2,020 yuan to the store. At this time, the store did not refund the money directly to the person who paid the bill. Instead, an individual paid 2,000 yuan to a third person. The relationship between this individual and the store, we can find out through some analysis, that he actually owns the store, so we call that a homonym relationship. It's that stores and people seem to be different entities, but in fact they have a very strong connection. Then the third person he pays to is not the person who swipes the card at the beginning, but a relative of the swipes the card, and the shopkeeper pays to the card of the relative's bank card. So a cash-out pattern like this is much more complicated than the one on the left. We call this pattern the multi-hop closed-loop pattern.

To analyze this multi-hop closed-loop pattern, it is necessary to find complex relationships, not just the individual analysis. But people might say, well, that's a very simple picture you drew, I can see at a glance, it's a closed loop, I can catch this bad guy very quickly.

But in real life things can be more complicated, with more other transactions and relationships, and it's not so easy to see. As shown in the figure below, the graph on the right may have hundreds of millions or even hundreds of millions of edges. How to quickly find out the ring on this graph puts forward very high requirements on the whole analysis technology -- complex relationship analysis technology, and performance becomes the key.

## When do I want to use a graph

As the amount of data and depth of relationship increases, if we use relational database to analyze data, it can be very, very slow and difficult to calculate the results timely. The graph computing technology directly locates and stores things and their relationships like drawing a map, and directly supports various queries and calculations of things and relationships. This is similar to the information processing mode of our brain, and the brain itself can also be modeled into a graph. Because it provides the most direct expression of the associated data, and the graph model has the natural tolerance for heterogeneous data, it can well solve the current problems of the associated data analysis.

Thus, relational databases are designed to answer "known" questions, while graph databases can answer "unknown" questions beyond imagination. Compared with relational databases, graph databases are databases that really focus on "relationships".

What we just gave is an example in financial industry, but the use of graph computing is far from limited to the financial industry. There are many applications in the Internet, manufactorying, medicine, public health, public safety and other fields. For example, drawing user social relationship graph to rank social influence and recommend friends; Construct the device relationship network graph to realize the Internet of Things modeling analysis, power supply network modeling analysis, etc.

With the exponential growth of data in the Internet and 5G era, the relationship between data is becoming more complex, making it more difficult for enterprises to manage and analyze data. More and more executives are looking to graph technologies to make smarter use of data. Tech giants like Google and Facebook have long leveraged graph databases to support key business applications.

Gartner, an internationally renowned consulting company, releases a variety of technology trends report every year. In its 2021 report Top 10 Trends in Data Analysis Technology, Gartner mentions "Graph relates everything." This is a very interesting pun on the graph connecting everything. On the one hand, it shows the essence of graph, which is to connect all kinds of things. On the other hand, it also shows that graph will be widely used in various fields of data analysis. Gartner predicts that graph technology will account for 80% of data and analytics innovation by 2025, up from 10% in 2021.
