Recently, GartnerÂ®, a global information technology research institute, released **Market Guide for Graph Database Management Systems** predicting that by 2025, the graph technology market, including graph database management systems, will break new thresholds and grow to $3.2 billion, with a compound annual growth rate of 28.1%.

Gartner predicts that "by 2025, graph technology will be used for 80 percent of data and analytics innovation, enabling faster decision-making in enterprises," up from 10 percent in 2021. In the Gartner Emerging Technologies and Trends Impact Radar for 2022, Graph Technologies is in the "Critical Enablers" quadrant with a "High" mass rating.

At the same time, the authoritative research institution Forrester released the report "Navigate The Data Management Ecosystem In China" that the graph platform delivers more modern insight and is superior to relational databases in real-time anti-fraud detection, social intelligence and other aspects. For example, Ant Group has applied graph related technology to the field of risk control, helping Alipay's asset loss rate in 2021 to be less than 0.98 parts per billion.

Graph computing is becoming a potential technology that market and research institutions focus on because of its leading technology, especially to meet the processing demand of the explosive growth of linked data.
