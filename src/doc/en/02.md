A few days ago, the Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC), an international authoritative technical association, announced that it unanimously approved the project approval of the world's first financial graph database test benchmark "LDBC Financial Benchmark" (FinBench). <strong>FinBench was initiated by Ant Group, with the participation of domestic and foreign technology companies such as Intel and Haizhi Xingtu, and is used to evaluate the function and performance of graph databases in financial scenarios. </strong>At present, LDBC has set up a special working group to promote the joint construction work, and it is planned to be officially released by the end of 2022.

LDBC and TPC are known as the two authoritative benchmark associations in the international database industry. LDBC focuses on graph data testing, including graph database performance testing based on social network scenarios (SNB, Social Network Benchmark). However, with the wide application of graph data in financial scenarios (such as anti-fraud, risk control, etc.), the starting point of SNB's social design can no longer meet the needs of financial scenarios. In order to match the differences in application scenarios, data patterns, and task loads of financial graph databases, and form a representative, reliable and comparable financial graph database evaluation test benchmark, Ant Group took the lead in cooperating with 8 domestic and foreign technology companies and industry experts. In February 2022, the FinBench project was jointly launched, and the project was officially approved after several rounds of rigorous demonstrations and discussions. <strong>After the completion of FinBench, it will enrich the LDBC multi-scenario test benchmarks, form corresponding standard documents and open source test software, and fill the gap in the global financial graph database test benchmarks. </strong>

Hong Chuntao, head of Ant Group’s graph database, believes that <strong>“A well-designed benchmark program can well simulate the distribution and query characteristics of data in actual applications, so that users can understand the performance of the database in actual applications. It is an important means of database selection and an important indicator to guide the development of the database.”</strong> Hong Chuntao introduced that FinBench involves many key technologies, so Ant Group has released a patent for “Graph Data Generation Method and Device”, hoping to let Its real implementation will reduce the cost of financial graph database selection and testing for industry practitioners. For better collaboration among benchmark participants, this benchmark code will be managed in an open-source manner, and the standard document will also be published on GitHub after completion.

Since the establishment of the graph database team in 2015, Ant Group has actively led or participated in the formulation of a number of international and domestic graph computing standards, such as the ISO-GQL graph data query language international standard, and the national standard for information technology graph database system technical requirements.

Graph data analysis has become a very popular emerging data analysis trend in recent years. By setting industry standards or test benchmarks, it will provide reference and guidance for the industry, greatly reduce the cost of technology implementation, and promote the healthy and mature development of the ecosystem.
