Background

<div class="ICDM-part-text p20">
Community detection is a well-established problem in the field of network science that involves partitioning a graph into connected components, or communities, while maintaining strong relationships among nodes within each community. This technique has been extensively used in numerous fields, including risk control and recommender systems. For instance, in risk control scenarios, segregating similar users into communities can be useful in monitoring malicious activities. Nevertheless, practical applications such as tracking malicious activities and fraudulent group mining often encounter obstacles due to insufficient labeled data, underscoring the significance of community detection methods.
<p><p>
The exponential growth of nodes and their connections in networks due to the proliferation of social networks and the Internet has resulted in community detection and fraudulent group mining becoming increasingly complex and challenging. As a solution to these issues, deep graph learning has emerged as an approach that can automatically learn high-level features in networks, enhancing the efficiency of community detection and fraudulent group mining. Nonetheless, the utilization of pretrained models in community detection and fraudulent group mining is a relatively new concept that necessitates further investigation and research. This competition offers a unique opportunity for participants to delve into the vast potential of pretrained models in community detection and fraudulent group mining. It encourages them to employ various techniques related to pretrained models and utilize them in these domains. The ultimate goal is to uncover the full range of possibilities that pretrained models offer in community detection and fraudulent group mining and drive innovative solutions in these areas.

Introduction
</div>

<div class="ICDM-part-text p20">
In the business scenario of black production fradulent group mining, the lack of label data and the huge scale of the graph structure bring challenges to community discovery. Traditional community discovery methods only focus on the topological structure of the network, while deep learning can not only utilize the topological structure, but also fully mine node and edge features, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of community discovery. However, these studies pay more attention to the modeling of specific business scenario data and tasks. With the rise of pretrained models, how to apply them to community discovery becomes an open and challenging problem.
This competition provides a medium-sized network dataset as a test set. The dataset contains a node feature table and an edge table, but no label table. Participants need to design a pre-training model, perform pre-training on the open source dataset given in the competition topic, use the model to perform community discovery on the above test set, and submit inference results. It should be noted that there is no corresponding relationship between the graph vertex IDs on the test set and the graph vertex IDs on the training set. It is best to use a pure inductive model for the pre-training model. It is hoped that these entries can provide valuable reference and reference for research and practical application in the field of community discovery.

This competition adopts the mode of pre-training on public data sets + prediction on non-public data sets:

- Pre-training stage: Contestants can pre-train the model on the following public data sets, the data list is as follows:
