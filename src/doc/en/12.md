Background
</div>
<div class="ICDM-part-text p20">
Community discovery is a classic problem in the field of network science. Its main purpose is to divide a given graph into several connected subgraphs (communities) and ensure that the nodes within each community have close relationships. Community discovery has been widely used in risk control, recommendation and other fields. For example, in risk control scenarios, dividing similar users into communities is conducive to tracking black products. However, in actual business, black industry tracking and gang mining tasks often face the difficulty of lacking a large amount of labeled data, so community detection methods become particularly important.
<p><p>
The rapid development of today's social networks and the Internet has led to a rapid increase in the number of nodes and connection relationships in the network, which also makes the problems of community discovery and gang mining more complex and challenging. In this context, deep graph learning has begun to be applied to community discovery and gang mining, which can automatically learn advanced features in the network and improve the effect of community discovery and gang mining. However, applying pre-trained models to community discovery and gang mining is still a relatively novel problem that requires more exploration and research. This competition provides a platform for participants to encourage them to use pre-trained model-related technologies and apply them to community discovery and gang mining, so as to explore the application potential of pre-trained models in these fields.

Introduction
</div>

<div class="ICDM-part-text p20">
In the business scenario of black production fradulent group mining, the lack of label data and the huge scale of the graph structure bring challenges to community discovery. Traditional community discovery methods only focus on the topological structure of the network, while deep learning can not only utilize the topological structure, but also fully mine node and edge features, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of community discovery. However, these studies pay more attention to the modeling of specific business scenario data and tasks. With the rise of pretrained models, how to apply them to community discovery becomes an open and challenging problem.
This competition provides a medium-sized network dataset as a test set. The dataset contains a node feature table and an edge table, but no label table. Participants need to design a pre-training model, perform pre-training on the open source dataset given in the competition topic, use the model to perform community discovery on the above test set, and submit inference results. It should be noted that there is no corresponding relationship between the graph vertex IDs on the test set and the graph vertex IDs on the training set. It is best to use a pure inductive model for the pre-training model. It is hoped that these entries can provide valuable reference and reference for research and practical application in the field of community discovery.

This competition adopts the mode of pre-training on public data sets + prediction on non-public data sets:

- Pre-training stage: Contestants can pre-train the model on the following public data sets, the data list is as follows:

  | data sets       | size  | node_num   | edge_num     | dim  | url                                                                                                                      |

- Test phase: Contestants need to use the trained pre-training model to predict the community labels of the test data set. The test data is an isomorphic graph. The test data set only contains the graph topology and node attributes, but does not contain community labels, and there is no correspondence between the graph vertex IDs on the test set and the graph vertex IDs on the training set.
