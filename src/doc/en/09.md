# TuGraph open-sourced JAVA client tool TuGraph-OGM, seamlessly connected to the JAVA development ecosystem

TuGraph database provides SDK support for JAVA, C++, Python and other languages, which is convenient for customers to use in various scenarios. The user uses the SDK to send a Cypher request to the TuGraph server, which returns the data as JSON. Recently, TuGraph launched a development tool for JAVA client users, TuGraph-OGM (Object Graph Mapping), provides users with an object operation interface, which is more convenient than Cypher/JSON interface.

Similar to the Object Relational Model (ORM) in a relational database, OGMs can automatically map data returned by databases to JAVA objects for users to read. Users' updates on these objects can also be automatically translated into Cypher statements and sent to the server. In this way, even users who do not understand Cypher at all can interact with the database by manipulating objects, greatly lowering the threshold of using the graph database.

Tugraph-ogm is also compatible with other open source product OGM tools, such as Neo4j-OGM, so that users can seamlessly migrate projects between different databases and TuGraph databases. This article will give a comprehensive introduction to TuGraph-OGM.

TuGraph-OGM maps JAVA objects to graph objects, classes to points, properties of classes to properties in graphs, and methods in classes to query statements that manipulate tugraphs.

<div style="text-align:center; font-size:12px; margin-bottom:20px;" > (Figure 1, movie scene graph) </div>

Taking a movie scene as an example, actors, movies, directors and their relationships form a very typical graph. To take a simple example, actress Alice has appeared in two films, Jokes and Speed, in 1990 and 2019, Frank Darabont is the director of Jokes.

From the perspective of graph thinking, actors, directors and movies can be mapped into three different nodes, while ACTS_IN and DIRECT can be mapped into two kinds of edges. The mapping results are shown in the graph above. After the data is stored in the graph database, developers can use the graph query language to query the data.

For developers unfamiliar with graph databases, the actors, directors, and movies in this example as entities can also be mapped to objects in classes, and objects associated with entities can be stored through collections, which is familiar to the  most developers.

TuGraph-OGM can be thought of as a "translator", whose main function is to translate some of the developer's operations on JAVA objects into Cypher requests understood by TuGraph, and to translate the results returned by this operation into JAVA objects again. The architecture diagram is shown below:

**3.1 Building Graph objects **

You first need to annotate the entities in the graph.

@NodeEntity: The class indicated in this annotation is a node class.

@Relationship: Used to indicate the edge. At the same time, the direction of label and edge can be specified in @Relationship.

@Id: indicates identity and is the unique identification of data in OGM.

**3.2 Establishing a Connection with TuGraph **

Currently, TuGraph-OGM provides an RPC driver for connecting to TuGraph. The specific configuration is as follows:

**3.3 Add, delete, modify and check through OGM **

OGM supports CRUD operations on TuGraph entities, as well as sending any Tugraph-supported Cypher statements, including calling stored procedures by CALL.

**CREATE**

After the graph object is built, a node can be created by instantiating the class. When two nodes are stored in each other's collection (which is labeled as an edge at build time), an edge is formed, and the data is finally stored in the database using the session.save method.

Note: TuGraph is a strong schema database. The label that requires the data exists before the entity is created, and a unique primary key must be provided during the creation process.

**DELETE**

Deleting a node using the session.delete method deletes all edges associated with the node.

**UPDATE**

Modifying the properties of the created node, calling the session.save method again updates the node.

**MATCH**

The session.load method is used to find nodes based on their id.
The session.loadALL method is used to search nodes in batches. It supports searching nodes by multiple node ids, searching all nodes of a certain type, and querying with filter.
Filtering queries need to create a new Filter, pass in the parameter ComparisonOperatorx0； The options are： EQUALSx0, GREATER_THANx0, LESS_THAN.

**QUERY WITH CYPHER**

OGM supports sending Cypher queries to TuGraph through the queryForObject method. Due to the flexibility of Cypher queries, users need to specify the return result format.

session.queryForObject method: You need to specify the return type at the first parameter of the method, which can be an entity class or a numeric type.

session.query method: The return Result of a Cypher query is stored as result, and its internal data needs to be parsed by the user. Take the following code as an example, the Cypher query passed into the database is a CREATE query, and the return result createResult can be parsed into QueryStatistics. You can get the number of nodes and edges created for this query.
