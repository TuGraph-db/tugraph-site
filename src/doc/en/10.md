#  Technical thinking and practice of Ant high performance graph database TuGraph-DB

In the recent DTCC 2022 13th China Database Technology Conference - Graph Data Technology and Application Innovation special session, Dr. Hong Chuntao, director of graph database of Ant Group, shared the technical thinking and practice of Ant high-performance graph database TuGraph-DB. The following is a review of the main points of the speech.

### Advantages of graph computing

Graph computation is an efficient abstract computation method, which can deal with complex multidimensional data conveniently. We draw a graph of the relationship between the employee and the company, so that we can quickly query the information of the employee, such as the employee's work situation, the relationship with other employees and the companies they are connected with. In contrast, in a relational database, we need to create a table of employee, a table of company , and a table of relationships between employees and companies. This will cut the whole data into many two-dimensional tables. In real systems, there are often hundreds or thousands of tables. This makes the system more complex and requires inferences based on multiple tables, which can be challenging for humans or machines.

The difference between simple and complex queries:

The first two rows in the table are simple queries, such as the working years of an employee. Just find the corresponding row and pull it out. Another example, such as finding all companies with more than 5 employees, may be found in the employment relationship table. This type of simple query can be done with a relational database.

If the query is more complicated, I would like to know what is the relationship between employee A and employee C, not necessarily a one-hop relationship, it may be a relationship of working in the same company, or a relationship of participating in the same project, or even a relationship It is that they have a common friend, and these relationships are various. It is actually not so easy to list all possible relationships with SQL.

Finally, there are more complex queries, such as looking for all the relationships between employee A and employee E, which may include A knowing B, B knowing C, and C knowing E, which is equivalent to doing a query with an indefinite length of hops. In this case, it is very difficult to write in SQL, and I believe it is difficult for most people to write this kind of query.

There is a saying in the industry that so-called relational databases are not really good at dealing with relationships. For example, all the relationships between employees A and E are actually the relationships we are querying, but it is actually not friendly to process such relational queries in a relational database. This is the advantage of graph databases, which are better at handling complex relational data. We find that most of the shallow data information can be mined  easily, but in order to make more in-depth use of the data to produce more value, we must dig deeper information, then we must encounter these complex relationships, which is why graph database is becoming more and more popular.

Why did graph databases become popular

The concept of graph database first appeared in the early 1970s and 1980s, but why did people choose to use graph database instead of relational database? I think the main reason was that computers were not that powerful at the time, and it was more computer friendly to use relational databases in the form of two-dimensional tables. We know that the best thing computers do is repetitive labor, repetitive tasks. If we want to find a row of data in a two-dimensional table, we can find it row by row, or we can use binary search(if the data is tree-ordered). Each layer has repeated algorithms running, making it a very structured piece of data for the computer, easy to work with. But if the data is abstracted into a graph, it becomes much more difficult for the computer to process.

For example, an employee may have a variety of different relationships with other people, such as friend relationships, employment relationships, and project involvement relationships, each of which has a different type of relationship and corresponding data. In addition, the number of edges on a point is also very irregular. Some people may only have a few friends, while on Weibo, an ordinary person may have two or three hundred fans, while a big V account may have millions or even hundreds of millions of fans. As a result, the difference between the average person and the big V when storing data is very large, and the difference for the computer to process the two types of data is also very large.

As we know, in the 1970s and 1980s, computers were relatively weak. If we used graphs to represent data at that time, the whole processing and query would be much more difficult. So, people choose to represent data in the form of relational tables. In fact, graph databases were done at the time, but they didn't catch on because the performance was much lower than relational databases.

We know that all things, especially computers, are improving all the time. This includes hardware and software improvements. Hardware today is not the same as it was decades ago, and software optimization is very different today. With these improvements, we will find that the additional overhead of using graph databases may not be a significant problem for current computers and computer systems.

For example, we will find that people used to write programs in low-level programming languages, but over time, there are high-level languages. For example, at the very beginning, the most primitive computer may be using paper bags and machine code to write programs, later there is assembly, and then C language, C++, and now many people directly write Python. While Python programs may be slow to execute, they are fast to write, and the whole process of writing a program to the end result is much easier in Python than in C++ or assembly.

Computer programming languages evolve from low level to high level, and so does data abstraction. Instead of focusing on being more machine friendly, we think the future of data abstraction must be more human-friendly. As shown in the figure, programming languages evolve from low-level to high-level languages, and we also believe that the level of data abstraction will slowly evolve from low-level table abstraction to high-level chart abstraction.

### Graph computation in ant applications

Since 2015, Ants have actually invested a lot of resources into graph computing and how to use graph computing in their business. For example, data kinship applications. In the process of business processing, we need to better track the flow path of these data, if a copy of the source data is modified, what will be the impact on the downstream data, what will be the impact on the final business. For better tracking, we use a graph database to store the data.

![images](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_qcdryc/afts/img/A*Bk61Tpye2asAAAAAAAAAAAAADgOBAQ/original)

Another interesting application scenario is program analysis. It is believed that almost all Internet companies have a large number of programs within them, so we need to manage these programs and understand what will be affected each time we submit code. To do this, the ant's program analysis team analyzes the graph here. For example, if you define A variable A and then use the variable A, there will be an edge between "define" and "use" and the usage relationship will be stored in the graph database. Right now we have over 20 billion edges in our graph, which is a very large amount of data. We need to store, query and analyze this data, and this is one of the many graph scenarios within Ant.

Take for example the scenario of coupon anti-cash: full coupon return is a relatively common way of promotion, for example, you can enjoy a discount of 100 yuan if you buy more than 2,000 yuan. In this case, if the user spends 2,000 yuan normally, he can save 100 yuan by returning the coupon. But some people will find ways to register fake shops and make fake transactions in order to cash out the coupons subsidized by the platform. Therefore, when users buy something and the platform pays subsidies, we need to detect whether there will be suspicious fund transactions in real time.

Ant has many businesses that need to study graph computing system and graph database and other technologies to meet the needs, because these businesses need to analyze a large number of points and edges, and the data volume exceeds 100TB, which has basically reached the PB level. We need to query these graphs in real time, with throughput in the millions. Because of the need to make real-time judgments about the user's payments, low latency is required, in the order of 20 milliseconds. If the delay is too long, it will result in a poor user experience, such as having to wait 5 seconds for a payment to complete, which can be very cumbersome.

Problems and Challenges in the construction of graph computing system

In the process of establishing ant map computing system, we have encountered various problems. In order to solve these problems, we have collaborated with colleagues in academia and many research communities, and published a number of relevant academic papers, including EuroSys. However, as we discovered in the process of building the system, current graph computing is still at a relatively early stage, so many standards have yet to take shape. This is a thorny problem for us. For example, in a relational database, the query language is basically SQL, but in a graph database, there are many query languages alone, including Gremlin, G-SQL, and so on. This leads to a fragmented market and high costs for people to learn and use.

In the process of establishing graph computing system, we also encountered many challenges. In order to share a large amount of traffic, the graph needs to be distributed across multiple machines, but this causes edge information to be passed between different machines, resulting in a lot of communication. In addition, the amount of data involved in a single query is also relatively large. For example, the number of points involved in a five-hop query has reached the fifth power of 10, and there are some very large points in the figure. At the same time, users' demands for graph computing systems are also very diverse, including fast query and complex algorithms(such as community discovery), and it is difficult for a single system to meet these different demands.

### TuGraph technology advantage

Ants themselves developed a set of graph computing system TuGraph, which can not only solve the problem of graph storage, but also solve the problem of flow computing, offline computing and graph learning. Currently, the system is used in over 100 lines of business and over 300 scenarios. The system won the World Internet Conference Leading Technology Achievement Award in 2021.

Performance is an important factor in TuGraph because of the large size of the graph data set, and poor performance can waste machine resources, leading to many cases where tasks cannot be completed. For example, a business query is expected to return results in tens of milliseconds, but if the performance is not good and the results return in a few seconds, it cannot be used as an online query. Therefore, we are very serious about performance, which in the LDBC-SNB standard test(similar to the database field performance standard test TPC-C), TuGraph is still the world record holder.

TuGraph's entire graph storage is based on perfect hashing, which is an important difference between us and other graph systems. Today, most graph systems use number-based storage, but the problem with numbers is that there is always a LogN lookup operation. However, as you can see in the diagram, the different vertices are actually out of order, and no order is required, so the level of vertices is actually based on hashing. In theory, the reading of vertices is optimal.

In addition, TuGraph is involved in the customization of many standards, and the system is trying to standardize as much as possible.

In addition to providing services internally, we also provide services externally, mainly because, as a system, it is easy to build a proprietary system if it serves only a limited number of customers. We want this to be a standardized, open system, so we are also providing graph computing system products and services. At present, we also have many external customers, including the financial, industrial, Internet and government and enterprise sectors.

Open source and open source, joint development

The graph computing system is still in its early stages, and we think there is a lot of work to be done to improve usability, performance, and cost. All systems have these problems. But if we want to be universal, we think it's important to have a healthy ecosystem to drive the graph computing system, which needs to be used by more users and more scenarios.

All computer systems need to have a more open, larger ecosystem in order to grow. Ants have a saying called "mature one, open one". When a system is mature, we will try to open it to more people to use it. In September of this year, we opened source TuGraph's stand-alone graph database on GitHub, as well as TuGraph Compute, an outlier analysis engine. Distributed graph database and flow graph computing are now included in our commercial version, including a one-stop graph development platform. We plan to iterate on more and richer system features in the future and hope to do even better.

### TuGraph Open Source Edition features

Why open source stand-alone instead of distributed? The main reason for this is that it is much cheaper to deploy and use than the distributed version, while still providing complete and independent functionality. We hope that this will get a lot of people who are just starting out with graph databases, or who have the idea of using graph databases to solve problems, to try our stand-alone graph database first. Because it is so simple to deploy, if it runs well, then consider whether you need a distributed version. If necessary, we can follow up on this issue.

Our standalone layout database is already capable of supporting terabytes of data, and we also use a standalone layout database for many cases internally. On a single machine, our maximum data volume has reached more than 2 terabytes, running online, can deal with tens of billions of points and edges. In fact, most users with a stand-alone layout database is adequate. Since the stand-alone map database is easy to optimize, we have optimized it to the extreme, so the stand-alone map database can meet the needs of most scenarios in terms of performance. In addition, its system features are comprehensive, including high availability, multi-graph support, permission management, logging, etc., and it can be viewed as a mature, easy-to-use graph database, similar to MySQL.

Some of the features listed in the open source version of TuGraph include:

- A standalone layout database can handle several terabytes of data, provided the disk is large enough.
- Very low cost, because it is a standalone version, easy to deploy and operate.
- The performance is good and we have optimized it a lot. TuGraph's LDBC-SNB test is currently the number one in the world, and you can get the terms and conditions for testing SNBS on GitHub.
- Standalone layout database is a very easy to use complete system, we provide import and export tools and query language. In addition, a low-level API is provided that users can use to write complex programs.

Our open source version has three main goals:

First, we want to provide a free graph database product that will get more people to use graph databases and try to solve problems with them.

Second, we want to facilitate the emergence of a graph database standard. There are so many different graph databases at the moment, and each one is different, that we hope to help achieve convergence by providing a reference answer. In this way, you can judge which features are reasonable based on the design we provide, and if you think they are reasonable, you can follow the design, and gradually you will get closer. If all products share the same key features, the cost of learning will be lower for all.

Finally, basic research problems can be optimized, including storage problems. For example, hashing may be theoretically optimal, but is there anything else that needs to be adjusted? At present, there is no good research platform for people to conduct these experiments and researches. We hope that the open source TuGraph-DB can be a baseline for these researchers to compare and promote the development of research.

### TuGraph Enterprise Edition features

In addition to open source versions, we continue to offer commercial versions as well. This release includes a distributed graph database, as well as an offline computing engine and streaming graph computing capabilities. In addition, we also provide TuGraph Platform one-stop graph platform, including operation, maintenance, visualization and other functions. On this platform, users can perform streaming calculations in the graph database and write back to the database online. This method is usually used to query the results in real time, because streaming may take a long time, but users can immediately query the earlier results. This is very important for online businesses.

The commercial product is also available for private deployment, and hardware can be deployed in an all-in-one way, and will soon be rolled out in the cloud so that people can experience our products on the cloud.

### Summary

Ant has invested a lot of resources in graph computing, and has honed a complete set of online query, stream computing, offline analysis and graph learning system in many business scenarios. At present, we have been on making open source stand-alone version(https://github.com/TuGraph-family), but also to provide enterprise edition to meet different user requirements.
