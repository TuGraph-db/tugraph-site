On September 1, 2022 World Artificial Intelligence Conference "New Generation graph intelligent technology Development and Practice Forum", Chen Wenguang, head of graph computing of Ant Group, announced that **open source Ant Group high-performance graph database TuGraph stand-alone version, and the establishment of graph computing open source technical committee **, Zheng Weimin and Chen Chun, academicians of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, serve as the chairman and vice chairman respectively. Five well-known experts in the industry serve as members.

TuGraph, developed by Ant Group and Tsinghua University, is the authoritative graph database test world record holder and the "fastest" graph database ever tested in the world.

**With the open source of TuGraph, users will have an open source product with excellent performance, rich functions and complete ecology **.

Developers can focus on the application layer and easily create their own graphs, thus raising the overall level of technology applications in the industry. TuGraph is using the Apache2.0 protocol and is hosted on Github and Gitee.

Graph database is different from relational database. Based on graph model, graph database uses points and edges to represent, store and process data. It has flexible data abstraction model, which can better express the concept of "relationship".

Ant TuGraph is a distributed graph DBMS, which can support real-time query on trillions of edges. The stand-alone version of the open source TuGraph also has complete basic functions of the graph database and mature product design, which can easily support TB level data and 10 billion level large graph, enough to meet the needs of most business scenarios. Compared with common open source products on the market, the performance of the TuGraph stand-alone version is more than 10 times higher..

Ant Group began to independently develop the distributed graph database, graph data streaming computing and other graph related technologies in 2015, and released the self-developed distributed graph database in 2016 and applied it to Alipay. So far, TuGraph has been applied to more than 150 scenarios inside Ant, including the real-time link of online payment. It has improved Alipay's risk identification ability by nearly 10 times and its risk trial and analysis efficiency by 90%, which verifies its high reliability.

Just last month, the LDBC (Linked Data Benchmark Council) released its latest SNB test results, showing that TuGraph takes the lead again in terms of functional completeness, throughput rate, and response speed.

At present, Ant Group has formed a set of large-scale graph computing system based on graph database, including graph data streaming computing and graph learning.

Hong Chuntao, head of graph database at Ant Group, said that graph technology is the key to the future development of big data, artificial intelligence and high-performance computing industries, and it is likely to become the foundation for next-generation data processing. Ant Group is willing to continue to export core technological advantages through open source, promote a wider application ecology of graph database, work with industry partners to explore and commercialize the latest technologies.
