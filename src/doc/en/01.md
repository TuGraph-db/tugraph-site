Recently, the Linked Data Benchmark Committee (LDBC), an international authoritative graph database testing organization, announced the latest results of the industry-wide Social Networking Benchmark (LDBC SNB). Ant Group's graph database TuGraph broke the official audit test record and once again won the first place in the world. This record has increased by 52% compared with the highest record throughput announced by LDBC earlier, It is also more than double the world record held by TuGraph two years ago.

According to the official report released by LDBC, in this test, TuGraph performed well under different scale datasets. On the dataset with the largest data size of 300G (800 million nodes, 5.3 billion edges), the throughput rate of TuGraph has increased by 52% compared with the previous official record, and has reached official standards in terms of system transactionality, recoverability, correctness, and stability, reflecting TuGraph's powerful performance advantages of high concurrency and low latency.

In order to be closer to the real scene and make the test more rigorous, TuGraph also adopts Client/Server deployment, deploying the client and server on two servers respectively, and completed this test under more stringent conditions (inherent network delay and network fluctuations).

Ant Group is also the initiator and main builder of LDBC's latest financial graph data test benchmark, Finbench.

## About LDBC and SNB tests

LDBC, or "Linked Data Benchmark Council", is a globally recognized benchmark guideline maker and testing organization in the field of graph databases. It is also known as the two authoritative technical organizations in the international database industry together with TPC.

SNB, or Social Network Benchmark, is one of the graph database-oriented benchmarks developed by LDBC. Because the SNB test is closer to the real system, it includes reading and writing tasks, simple and complex queries, specifies the response time of the system, and better reflects the overall performance of the system. It is currently the most mature and general performance test in the graph data industry.

The LDBC SNB test is conducted by a designated third-party organization. From data import to result verification, it is performed by the third party on the cloud platform. The final results are audited and announced by the LDBC Executive Committee, ensuring the credibility of the results to the greatest extent. At the same time, SNB also published the programs and scripts used in the test process, as well as the detailed results generated during the test process, which further ensured the reproducibility of the test.

## About TuGraph

Ant Group's graph database TuGraph is a one-stop data storage and analysis system based on graph models. It is good at handling large-scale associated data management and analysis, such as social relations, logistics services, equipment pipe networks, financial transactions and other scenarios, with thousands of times of optimization Analytical performance, naturally with data visualization display.

TuGraph has industry-leading cluster scale and performance, and is an important infrastructure for Ant Groupâ€™s financial risk control capabilities. It has significantly improved the real-time identification capabilities and trial analysis efficiency of financial risks such as fraud and money laundering, and provided stable decision-making support capabilities. Alipay's ability to identify important risks has increased by nearly 10 times, and the efficiency of risk review and analysis has increased by 90%.

TuGraph has been maturely used in scenarios such as security risk control, credit risk control, knowledge graph, data lineage, fund analysis, traffic attribution analysis, membership relationship, etc., and is oriented to customers in industries such as finance, industry, and government services.
