Graph database is the core of knowledge graph system. In reality, why do you want to choose a graph database, and how should you choose a graph database?

> Hong Chuntao, head of Graph database of Ant Group, analyzed and answered these questions in his speech at Datafun, a knowledge sharing community. The following is a transcript of the speech.

## 1. Why choose a graph databaseï¼Ÿ

Graph database is the core of knowledge graph system. In a typical knowledge graph system, data will be stored in the graph database after knowledge extraction, sorting and reasoning, and then the graph database will support the query, update, inference and other tasks of the knowledge graph. Therefore, the selection of graph data determines the scale, performance and stability of the graph system, which is very important for the application of the whole graph system.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 255);" > At present, there are many graph database in the market. Such as Neo4j, JanusGraph, and TuGraph which developed by Ant Group. The overall number is about dozens. However, there are significant differences between them. For example, Neo4j uses Cypher and JanusGraph uses Gremlin for query languages.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 255);" The graph model of the graph database is also very different </span>. At present, most graph databases are mainly property graphs, and there is another type of graph called RDF graphs. These two graph databases are different from each other in terms of data abstraction, and many other features, such as whether there are user permissions, whether there are multiple graphs, and whether there are hypergraphs, are also very different.

The main problem is that, unlike a relational database, which has a standard relational algebra abstraction with the standard SQL language on top. At present, the graph database has not been completely standardized, So it brings some confusion to users. They do not know how to choose a proper graph database.

"> <span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 255); At present, the application of graph database is exploratory </span>. Users do not know in advance which algorithms will be used and which features are needed in specific scenes, so it is more difficult to choose the proper graph database.

<div style="color:#888; font-size:12px; margin-bottom:10px; margin-top:-20px; text-align:center;" > So how do we do graph database system selection? </div>

<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 255);" > A very important tool for the selection of graph database system is the Benchmarking. </span> It will simulate the real scene to test the system, which is a relatively standard test program.

Take TPC-C as an example. This is a very standard benchmark for testing relational databases. It simulates the use of databases by chain stores, which build order management systems, inventory management systems, and logistics management. The program itself dictates how far transactional support should go, how much concurrency there should be, and what the latency requirements for each query should be. If a relational database can correctly pass the test of TPC-C and get the corresponding concurrency and latency metrics, then users can roughly estimate its function and performance under normal real conditions, and further estimate its function and stability under real scenarios.

So Benchmark can guide the design of database system, and it is very important to accelerate the development of the whole industry.

## 2. What kind of benchmarks do we need

A good Benchmark has the following features.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 255);" > First, it must be realistic. The scenario it chooses must be more realistic. </span> For example, if TPC-C wants to simulate the management system of a store, the data and operation must be similar to the store. Take inventory management and order management as an example, the number of reads and writes of these queries and the mixing ratio between them all need to be realistic.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 255);" > In terms of performance , certain latency requirements must be met. </span> read-write ratio Concurrency has certain requirements, such as how many users will be using it at the same time, what is the latency requirement, must require that the query should be in the tens of milliseconds, all have certain requirements. Query out of the time if too long, certainly does not meet the normal demand.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 255);" > And it must be extensible. </span> In real tests, store sizes vary, and if a Benchmark specifies only one data size, it's hard to give the user a sense of what's going on underneath their own scenario. For example, a user wants to open a store and select a database, but the test data of Benchmark may only limit 1GB of data, while the actual user's data is 1TB, so the Benchmark has no reference value. Therefore, most good benchmarks have scalability. If you want to measure 1GB, 100GB, 1TB or even 10TB, there are ways to do it.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 255);" </span> </span> This is very important. Graph data testing can not be completed randomly with the data of TPC-C, such as reading without writing. When testing, all the write operations are removed, and a result appears to be high, but in fact it is meaningless, because it does not meet the actual test standards. So the standard itself has to be rigorous, it has to have audit rules, it has to have validation of the data.

Now graph database commonly used several test programs, one is Twitter, that is, Twitter published data set to run K-hop, starting from a point to find K degree neighbors, and to run graph algorithm, this test method has a big problem. One is that the Twitter graph itself is very limited and not scalable. The points and edges on the graph have no attributes, which is actually not true. In addition, it is a social graph, unlike many other popular financial graphs, so it should only be used as a simple reference. The most fatal is that it only reads without writing, when testing can not measure its write operation, or to measure the write operation can only add a few edges and a few points, which is very not rigorous.

Some vendors will add some of their own tests in the selection, such as hoping to test some read and write mixing, and then select some sample data from their own data, do read and write operations. This practice is actually substandard, and it's okay to do this test if you know exactly what data to use and what to do under a scenario. But in most cases, we do not know which scenarios will be used in the future, it can only test a very limited number of scenarios, but in the future may add many other services, it is possible that this number will grow in the future.

Therefore, it can only be used as a simple reference, not scalable or rigorous..

That's why we need to benchmark.

## 3. How to do benchmarking for graph databases in financial scenarios

The Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC) is a world-renowned non-profit technology association. Currently there are three benchmarks, one is RDF graph based on semantic network, one is graph analysis, and the other is graph SNB of social network.

At present, the international standard graph database benchmarking is LDBC SNB. LDBC SNB simulates the application scenario of social networking sites to graph database. It generates data according to the data characteristics of social networking sites. The SNB test simulates the application scenarios of social networking sites. Data is generated according to the data characteristics of social networking sites. Data of various sizes will be generated. At the same time, there are mixed read and write operations, and various rich semantics for reading. There is a very standard documentation, there are also third-party audits.

SNB test simulates a social scene, which contains 14 types of points and 20 types of edges. There will be some attributes on the points and edges. The smallest data size can be set: SF1, which is about 1GB of data generated, and the maximum can be SF100, SF300, SF1000 and SF30000.

In terms of operation, it has two types. One is Interactive, which simulates online query. There are seven types of simple reading and 14 types of complex reading on it. There are eight types of write operations, and the actual test will require that these read-write mixes be sent concurrently to the graph database. The other is BI Workload. The BI query, which is a complex read-only query, is even more complex than the complex read above, and is basically an OLAP-like application of global scanning. It writes in bulk, so this is very different from Interactive above.

On some of the validations, it requires read/write mixing, it requires correctness verification, after these reads and writes are done, it needs to check the correctness of the current database, and then it has transaction isolation requirements, and most importantly, it has latency requirements, each query stipulates that only about one thousand requests can time out, If the delay is more than 100 milliseconds the query is more than one thousandth. So this percentage is too high and the database is not acceptable.

SNB simulates the data of a social networking site, in which there are nodes of people and nodes of forums. There are many posts in the forums, and then people can re-produce these posts. At the same time, this person will have a variety of information, such as his company, university and city. It is a typical graph query.

We found that under Ant's own application scenarios, there are many differences from SNB, so we decided to make a financial graph Benchmark together with LDBC. What are the main differences between financial Benchmark and SNB?

First of all, there is a difference in the scene. SNB is a social scene, and we are different types of scenes such as financial risk control, so there will be a big difference in the data. The graph of social network has its particularity. Firstly, it tends to have a lot of big points. For example, an influencer account on Weibo will attract a lot of attention, which is a big point. Then the points in it will have a relatively high average visibility. For example, each micro-blog account will have an average of about 300 followers. These characteristics make the social graph different from other graphs, and the financial graph less visible.

There are no repeated edges between points in the model of SNB, but there are a lot of repeated edges in the financial graph. For example, two people often transfer money, so there will be a lot of repeated edges between them. The query of the financial graph is also very different from the calculation, and the query has higher latency requirements. If it doesn't come back within 20 milliseconds, the whole user experience will suck.

In SNB, reading and writing are separate. It is possible to read and write in the financial graph in the same Query. We're going to look for a lot of loops and triangles, and these are all things that are different from SNB. Therefore, this is also a major motivation for us to make financial graph Benchmark.

At present, our financial graph Benchmark is still in the design stage. It is mainly an online query, which requires high delay. In addition, we will design the peaks and troughs of the load, because the flow is generally small in the middle of the night; We will have TTL for the data, and we will clean up the expired data. For example, the data stored in the general system for three months will be automatically recycled after three months.

Here is a relatively simple example of a read and write Query.

In addition, we will also do some anti-fraud, anti-cash operations, which is also the financial scene often need to solve the problem. We will use the financial graph database Benchmark as a standard.

## Conclusion

Based on the above, we believe that the graph database is the core of the graph application system, so its selection is very important, and Benchmark is very important as the most powerful tool for selection. Benchmark, if done well, can be a de facto standard to guide system design. We also propose more people to participate in the development and formulation of Benchmark with us, promote the standardization of graph database system, and build the industry ecology together.
